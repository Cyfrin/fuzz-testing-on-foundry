# Foundry Fuzz and Invariant Testing

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to demonstrating and implementing fuzz and invariant testing using Foundry, a powerful Ethereum development framework. Foundry allows for extensive testing of smart contracts, enabling developers to catch bugs and ensure contract robustness. The focus of this repository is on leveraging Foundry's capabilities for fuzz testing and invariant testing of smart contracts.

## Fuzz Testing
Fuzz testing in Foundry involves automatically generating a wide range of inputs to test functions in smart contracts. This method helps in uncovering edge cases and ensuring that the contract behaves correctly under various scenarios.

## Invariant Testing
Invariant testing is about defining certain conditions or invariants that should always hold true for the state of the contract, regardless of the actions performed on it. These invariants are then tested to ensure they hold under different conditions and actions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Install Foundry: Follow the instructions on the [Foundry installation guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.html) to set up Foundry on your machine.

### Running Tests
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.
   
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```   


1. **Navigate to the Repository Directory**: Change your current working directory to the repository folder.
   

```bash
cd path/to/repository
```


1. **Run Foundry Tests**: Execute the following command to run the tests using Foundry.
   
```bash
forge test
 ```
